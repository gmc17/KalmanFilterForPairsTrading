# Kalman Filter for Pairs Trading

## Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying profitable trading pairs in the stock market using cointegration tests. It then implements the Kalman filters as both a price estimator and method to dynamically estimate hedge ratio. The algorithm is then backtested and produces a portfolio with about a 2.08 Sharpe ratio.

## Features
- **Cointegration Tests**: Identification of stock pairs with a statistically significant cointegration relationship, using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
- **Kalman Filters**: Application of Kalman Filters for dynamic regression and state estimation in time series analysis.
- **Backtesting Framework**: Implementation of a robust backtesting logic to evaluate the performance of trading strategies.
- **Analysis Tools**: Analysis and visualization of strategy performance.
